What I mean by that. For me a game that I can simple beat and delete. Or in the case of the Switch archive. For example I consider Mario Wonder a game that I can beat and delete (Which I did). A game in which has no replayability after beating it. Like there's no reason to comeback and play it. I'm not getting any dlc for the game. Updates if any would be bug fixes/stability. And by that point I've already beat the game. So it wouldn't have any use to me. I don't play Wonder's online mode. If any of that makes sense (I hope it made some type of sense) I don't consider Showtime that type of game. Since after beating it there's replayability. \n\n>I wish each transformation got a rehearsal, and at least one non story stage for completing everything.\n\nYeah I was thinking the same thing! Speaking of completing everything. If you know please let me know. I haven't completely 100% the game yet. I still have hide and seek in the basement, all the boss challenges and buying everything from the shops. Do you get anything for 100% the game completely? Like do you get a special dress for Preach or does the flower partner get something. Or maybe a special completion statute you can output in the theater. Also is there some type of message or pop up saying something along the lines of \"Hey you've 100% complete the game\". And do you get some type of star next to your save file indicating you've 100% complete it. Well never mind I guess there really isn't save files. More a less a save per account.\n\n>When I think about it, seems they just didn't want to drag it out for the target audience. Hopefully they'll include more completion rewards if there's another game\n\nYeah that's totally understandable! I'm glad that even though it was made for a target audience. They still had things (such as the boss challenges) that also appealed to the more older audience such as myself. Yeah same! I hope they do make another game! Even with it made for the younger kids I still thoroughly enjoyed it! I really like how with each transformation it was essentially a different play style. I do hope in the next game (provided there is one) they add more difficulty option for the more older audience who likes more of a challenge. I mean they kinda did with the boss challenges.

I've loved Princess Peach for years now. I've never played as anybody else in any game where she's playable, my profile picture and phone wallpaper are usually always some variation of Peach, I've been collecting every single Peach amiibo and slowly building a merch collection for her, I've followed every peach fan account under the sun, I've redownloaded Mario Kart Tour every time a new Peach variant came out (and subsequently got pissed at the stupid warp pipe and uninstalled the app after not getting them and running out of ways to grind rubies because I don't want to spend money on them), and I've legitimately loved this character with all my heart for years.\n\nAnd for years I've been called crazy because nobody respects her like her diehard fans do. Why would they? There's nothing to respect about the walking archetype that she's always been cheaply used for. Even in the one singular game where she was given spotlight, it wasn't anything more than a cheap \"oh look, they swapped places, how wacky\" line, and the only abilities they could think of for her were just \"uhhhh woman emotional huh huh huh\". She never got the respect that she deserved from Nintendo, and as a result, outside of her incredibly dedicated fanbase, the fans never really respected her either. After all, how could you respect a character that isn't even respected by her creators?\n\nSo now finally, after so many years of bullshit, a false sense of hope from 3D world only for the gut punch that was odyssey (with slight relief from the ending, but still), and the spit in the face from Bowser's Fury, *finally* in the beautiful year of two thousand and twenty-fucking-three, is Peach finally getting some respect on her name. \n\nStarting with the movie, she was treated as, gasp, an actual fucking ruler and monarch instead of a woman in a refrigerator. She instead took up the role more comparable to the wise elder, without overselling it so that it didn't feel like Peach. Her voice actress also gave the best performance in the movie. That doesn't have anything to do with the essay but Anya Taylor Joy did a great job, I approve. \n\nThen later in the year, we not only got a new 2D Mario where Peach is playable and therefore not just the plot point again, but she also got her own game. \n\nThis one seems leagues better than super princess peach. That game didn't respect her or her character much at all, it pretty much just served as the quirky character swap story as I mentioned previously. This one however, not only throws her into her own location and makes her the protagonist, but it also gives her a story with nothing to do with Mario or saving him to make a character swap story, and genuinely makes it truly about her. Princess fucking Peach. It gives her her own story, her own villain, her own setting, her own motivation, her first true chance to be the hero. To be the bad assed bitch I've always seen her as. To be the character to stan loud and fucking proud and finally be understood as to why. \n\nThis is truly the turn of her character and story that Zelda got forever ago, and she was so long overdue for. This is what makes me proud to have been by her side for so many years. This is what finally validates the decades of abuse and torment that us peach fans have been put through. Nintendo finally realizes and respects the character that is Princess Peach, and now their fans can finally begin to follow suit.\n\nEither that, or I'm just a mentally ill teenager. Either way, I'm excited. \n\nReally hope the next 3D Mario doesn't invalidate this whole essay by throwing her right back in the cage.", "external_links": [], "comments": ["This is Peach's Second Game where she's the Protagonist, let's not forget Super Princess Peach for the Nintendo DS back in 200X", "I directly address that if you actually read the post\n\nThis is the first time where he's truly respected for her own character in her own game", "TL;DR", "Then move on\n\nRead the post or don't"]},

Teaching girls they can be anything. She\u2019s like Barbie for gamers. Look at all the stuff she can do! In this essay we will be talking about Peach as a swordsman, peach as a chef, and Peach as a kung fu.\n\nPeach is a great swordsman. As the great Zoro the minority hunter once said, \u201cso what if you\u2019re a girl\u201d(One Piece anime, Ep 19). A little context, Zoro was training at the swordy word camp and he got beat every day by his friend and rival Kuina. Kuina was raised in a society that women are oppressed and she said that zoro will beat her one day cause she\u2019s gonna grow boobs and get bad at swords. Zoro called her BS and reminded her that she is the goal he wants to reach. Womankind is more than a gender. We are people with ambitions and goals, and we stand on equal ground with men (apart from things like sports cuz testosterone).\n\nPeach is a chef!! She would make the yummiest dinners I bet! The woman is meant to stay home and cook while the man goes off the work. Peach would make a great stay at home mom. My mom was a stay at home mom and she cooked dinner. I wonder if Peach could open a restaurant! Nah, that\u2019s a man\u2019s business. She can just stay in the comfort of her own kitchen. Besides, there she is safe from the world and Bowser can\u2019t kidnap her for the 100th time. Women should always stay inside and never leave the house because men can\u2019t control their dicks.\n\nPeach is a kung fu warrior! She can fight like nobody\u2019s business! They made her an action figure! I hope they sell princess peach action figures at the release of this game. Or at least an amiibo. If they made amiibos for all of her forms, I would probably buy them. I am a regular at the Buy Best and they know to save a copy of every new amiibo they get in the back for me! Have you ever been that notorious, dear reader? I\u2019m actually kind of a big deal. I am a celebrity and I am a YouTube star.\n\nIn conclusion Peach games are bringing empowerment to womankind. We can handle our knives, we are safest in the kitchen, and all the Peach amiibos for me.

I definitely enjoyed the overall experience.\n\nSwordfighter Peach: Liked this one. Abilities were decent and it was a great introduction to the game. Not too difficult.\n\nDetective Peach: Mysteries are a guilty pleasure of mine and I really enjoyed all three of these levels. I will say they could've been fleshed out more. The levels were super easy. Like evil dudes hiding in plain sight... Are you not even going to try and be mysterious??\n\nPatissier Peach: This one pissed me off. I think it's because I'm horrible at the mini games. Like cakes are spinning while you're trying to decorate them and also while you're racing against the clock... Disliked these levels.\n\nKung Fu Peach: The boss in these levels was pretty cool. Once I got a hang of the mechanics I enjoyed it.\n\nNinja Peach: To be honest Ninja and Kung Fu should've been combined into one character. I liked the hiding abilities but the combat was pretty similar to the King Fu mode. Confused as to why they made them two separate levels.\n\nCowgirl Peach: I'm bad at the fast paced stuff and the cowgirl section has mechanics that I just was really bad it. Although I really liked the set design and art direction for these.\n\nFigure Skater Peach: It was like dance dance Revolution but like QuickTime events that moved on the floor. I got overwhelmed. Fun boss though. I enjoyed these levels once it got near the end.\n\nDashing Thief Peach: This one was rather fun. The abilities you get in here are pretty fun to play with. I liked the story here too. \n\nMermaid Peach: I understand why they did a water level but it broke the immersion for me. The other levels try and use theatre aspects, like your horse in the cowgirl levels is a puppet on strings... But I really don't understand how a theatre could do this underwater stuff. Also super boring ability that gets frustratingly annoying when the level scrolls and you're stuck in one place.\n\nMighty Peach: I don't like Sci Fi stuff so this was a miss for me. Enjoyed the ability to pick up cars and punch really big.\n\nOther things: I think the difficult was a bit all over the place. Some levels were really hard and some were way too easy. I think I would've preferred an even spread of difficulty over the whole game. I couldn't tell who the target audience was... \n\nAs a theatre kid I think they missed out on some opportunities with utilising more theatre motifs. I really thought the final boss battle with Grape would be like backstage through all the tech. I expected to be running though areas with props you could pick up to embody that character type. Like getting the lasso from the cowgirl levels and using that ability against Grape, then becoming the spy and having to use the grappling hook ... I was waiting for a time to be able to use all the abilities in one level and it just never happened. \n\nWhen it comes to the dresses that you can buy... I was expecting more than just different textures of her original pink dress. I was hoping we'd be able to unlock the outfits from the levels. Also some of the patterns given were super ugly. I wanted to wear more than just that dress. Was a bit disappointed with the customization. Like her final boss dresses are gorgeous and we can't play or use them at all...\n\nI did beat the game though and I usually get too bored to beat any game. I played this constantly for two days. I really want DLC for more levels or features. I feel like I completed it too quickly and now all I have left is repeating the levels to get more unlockables but I'm not the type to care too much about getting those.\n\nI give it a solid 7/10 \ud83e\ude77", "external_links": [], "comments": []},
