IASP leads the global role in suicide prevention by strategically developing an effective forum that is proactive in creating strong collaborative partnerships and promoting evidence-based action in order to reduce the incidence of suicide and suicidal behaviour.\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates more than 700,000 people die due to suicide each year and that almost 77% of all global suicides occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). For every suicide there are many more who attempt suicide or have serious suicidal ideation. Suicidal behaviour profoundly impacts families and communities and remains a universal challenge with millions impacted. The reduction of suicide mortality is of global importance and a vital public health consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\nDISCOVER LATEST NEWS \n\n\n\n \n\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day 2024\u00a0\n\nMarch 8, 2024\n\n\nInternational Women\u2019s Day is an annual day of celebration on March 8, observed with a focus on issues such as gender equality, women empowerment, and reproductive rights.\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPresident\u2019s Message\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\n\nThere is much to reflect upon and look forward to as we embark on 2024.

But by reaching out for help or checking in with family and friends, we can avoid devastating outcomes.\nAccording to the CDC and NIMH, nearly 46,000 lives were lost to suicide in 2020 alone. Comments or thoughts about suicide, also known as suicidal ideation, can begin small \u2014 for example, \u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t here\u201d or \u201cNothing matters.\u201d But over time, they can become more explicit and dangerous.\nWarning Signs\nHere are a few other warning signs of suicide:\n\nIncreased alcohol and drug use\nAggressive behavior\nWithdrawal from friends, family and community\nDramatic mood swings\nImpulsive or reckless behavior\n\nSuicidal behaviors are a psychiatric emergency. If you or a loved one starts to take any of these steps, seek immediate help from a health care provider or call 988 to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:\n\nCollecting and saving pills or buying a weapon\nGiving away possessions\nTying up loose ends, like organizing personal papers or paying off debts\nSaying goodbye to friends and family\n\nIf you are unsure, a\u00a0licensed mental health professional\u00a0can help assess.\nRisk Factors\nResearch has found that\u00a046%\u00a0of people who die by suicide had a known mental health condition. Several other factors may put a person at risk of suicide, including but not limited to:\n\nA family history of suicide\nSubstance use:\u00a0Drugs can create mental highs and lows that worsen suicidal thoughts.\nIntoxication:\u00a0Analysis from the CDC indicates around\u00a01 in 5\u00a0people who die by suicide had alcohol in their system at the time of death.\nAccess to firearms\nA serious or chronic medical illness\nGender: Although\u00a0more women\u00a0than men attempt suicide, men are\u00a04x\u00a0more likely\u00a0to die by suicide.\nA history of trauma or abuse\nProlonged stress\nA recent tragedy or loss\n\nSupport In A Crisis\nWhen a suicide-related crisis occurs, friends and family are often caught off-guard, unprepared and unsure of what to do. The behaviors of a person experiencing a crisis can be unpredictable, changing dramatically without warning.\nThere are a few ways to approach a suicide-related crisis:\n\nTalk openly and honestly. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions like: \u201cDo you have a plan for how you would kill yourself?\u201d\nRemove means such as guns, knives or stockpiled pills\nCalmly ask simple and direct questions, like \u201cCan I help you call your psychiatrist?\u201d\nIf there are multiple people around, have one person speak at a time\nExpress support and concern\nDon\u2019t argue, threaten or raise your voice\nDon\u2019t debate whether suicide is right or wrong\nIf you\u2019re nervous, try not to fidget or pace\nBe patient\n\nLike any other health emergency, it\u2019s important to address a mental health crisis like suicide quickly and effectively. Unlike other health emergencies, mental health crises don\u2019t have instructions or resources on how to help or what to expect (like the Heimlich Maneuver or CPR). That\u2019s why NAMI created\u00a0Navigating a Mental Health Crisis: A NAMI Resource Guide for Those Experiencing a Mental Health Emergency, so people experiencing mental health emergencies and their loved ones can have the answers and information they need when they need it.\nIf your friend or family member struggles with suicidal ideation day-to-day, let them know that they can talk with you about what they\u2019re going through. Make sure that you adopt an open and compassionate mindset when they\u2019re talking. Instead of \u201carguing\u201d or trying to disprove any negative statements they make (\u201cYour life isn\u2019t that bad!\u201d), try active listening techniques such as reflecting their feelings and summarizing their thoughts. This can help your loved one feel heard and validated.\nLet them know that mental health professionals are trained to help people understand their feelings and improve mental wellness and resiliency.\u00a0Psychotherapy, like cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy, can help a person with thoughts of suicide recognize ineffective patterns of thinking and behavior, validate their feelings and learn positive coping skills. Suicidal thoughts are a symptom, just like any other \u2014 they can be treated, and they can improve over time.\nSuicide is not the answer.

on Friday due to complications of metastatic pancreas cancer, the court announced. She was 87.\n    \n\n            Ginsburg was appointed in 1993 by President Bill Clinton and in recent years served as the most senior member of the court\u2019s liberal wing, consistently delivering progressive votes on the most divisive social issues of the day, including abortion rights, same-sex marriage, voting rights, immigration, health care and affirmative action. \n    \n\nLIVE UPDATES: Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died\n\n\n            Her death \u2013 less than seven weeks before Election Day \u2013 opens up a political fight over the future of the court. Addressing the liberal justice\u2019s death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday evening, \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\u201d\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 14: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is seen as she presents the Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Inaugural Woman of Leadership Award to Agnes Gund at The Library of Congress on February 14, 2020 in Washington, DC.

What else can you say?\u201d President Donald Trump said Friday evening upon hearing about her death. \u201cShe was an amazing woman whether you agree or not she was an amazing woman who led an amazing life.\u201d \n    \n\n            Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden praised Ginsburg as a \u201cgiant in the legal profession\u201d and a \u201cbeloved figure,\u201d saying in brief on-camera remarks Friday evening that people \u201cshould focus on the loss of the justice and her enduring legacy.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cBut there is no doubt, let me be clear that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider,\u201d he added, saying that was the position of Republicans who refused to vote on then-President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee in 2016.\n    \n\n            Obama, in a statement mourning Ginsburg, also called for Senate Republicans to uphold the standard they set in 2016 when they blocked  his nominee.\n    \n\n            \u201cOver a long career on both sides of the bench \u2013 as a relentless litigator and an incisive jurist \u2013 Justice Ginsburg helped us see that discrimination on the basis of sex isn\u2019t about an abstract ideal of equality; that it doesn\u2019t only harm women; that it has real consequences for all of us. It\u2019s about who we are \u2013 and who we can be,\u201d Obama said in a statement.\n    \n\n\n    Remembering Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n  \n\nConversations: My closed-door sessions with GinsburgPhotos: Look back at Ginsburg\u2019s life and careerVideo: Hear her most memorable speechesTributes: Mourners gather to pay their respectsOpinion: What Ginsburg taught men about women\n\n\n\n\n\n            He added, \u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg fought to the end, through her cancer, with unwavering faith in our democracy and its ideals. That\u2019s how we remember her. But she also left instructions for how she wanted her legacy to be honored. Four and a half years ago, when Republicans refused to hold a hearing or an up-or-down vote on Merrick Garland, they invented the principle that the Senate shouldn\u2019t fill an open seat on the Supreme Court before a new president was sworn in.\n    \n\n            A basic principle of the law \u2013 and of everyday fairness \u2013 is that we apply rules with consistency, and not based on what\u2019s convenient or advantageous in the moment.\u201d\n    \n\n            Ginsburg developed a rock star status and was dubbed the \u201cNotorious R.B.G.\u201d In speaking events across the country before liberal audiences, she was greeted with standing ovations as she spoke about her view of the law, her famed exercise routine and her often fiery dissents.\n    \n\n            \u201cOur Nation has lost a jurist of historic stature,\u201d said Chief Justice John Roberts. \u201cWe at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her \u2013 a tireless and resolute champion of justice.\u201d\n    \n\n            Ginsburg, who died on the eve of the Jewish new year, was surrounded by her family at her home in Washington, DC, the court said. A private interment service will be held at Arlington National Cemetery.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her chambers in Washington, Aug. 23, 2013. Ginsburg on July 14, 2016, apologized for her recent remarks about the candidacy of Donald Trump, saying \"On reflection, my recent remarks in response to press inquiries were ill-advised, and I regret making them.\"\n\nTodd Heisler/The New York Times/Redux\n\n\n\ngallery\n          \n\n\nRelated gallery\nIn photos: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\n\n\n\n            Ginsburg had suffered from five bouts of cancer, most recently a recurrence in early 2020 when a biopsy revealed lesions on her liver. She had said that chemotherapy was yielding \u201cpositive results\u201d and that she was able to maintain an active daily routine.\n    \n\n            \u201cI have often said I would remain a member of the Court as long as I can do the job full steam,\u201d she said in a statement in July 2020. \u201cI remain fully able to do that.\u201d\n    \n\n            She told an audience in 2019 that she liked to keep busy even when she was fighting cancer. \u201cI found each time that when I\u2019m active, I\u2019m much better than if I\u2019m just lying about and feeling sorry for myself,\u201d she said in New York at the Yale Club at an event hosted by Moment Magazine. Ginsburg told another audience that she thought she would serve until she was 90 years old. \n    \n\n            Tiny in stature, she could write opinions that roared disapproval when she thought the majority had gone astray. \n    \n\n            Before the election of President Donald Trump, Ginsburg told CNN that he \u201cis a faker\u201d and noted that he had \u201cgotten away with not turning over his tax returns.\u201d She later said she regretted making the comments and Trump suggested she should recuse herself in cases concerning him. She never did. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg most memorable speeches ak orig_00000000.jpg\n\nStanford University\n\n\n\nvideo\n          \n\n\nRelated video\nHear RBG's most memorable speeches\n\n\n\n\n            In 2011, by contrast, President Barack Obama singled out Ginsburg at a White House ceremony. \u201cShe\u2019s one of my favorites,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a soft spot for Justice Ginsburg.\u201d\n    \n\n            The vacancy gives Trump the opportunity to further solidify the conservative majority on the court and fill the seat of a woman who broke through the glass ceiling at a time when few women attended law school with a different justice who could steer the court to the right on social issues.\n    \n\n            Ginsburg was well-known for the work she did before taking the bench, when she served as an advocate for the American Civil Liberties Union and became the architect of a legal strategy to bring cases to the courts that would ensure that the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection applied to gender. \n    \n\n            \u201cI had the good fortune to be alive and a lawyer in the late 1960s when, for the first time in the history of the United States, it became possible to urge before courts, successfully, that society would benefit enormously if women were regarded as persons equal in stature to men,\u2019\u201d she said in a commencement speech in 2002.\n    \n\n            Once she took the bench, Ginsburg had the reputation of a \u201cjudge\u2019s judge\u201d for the clarity of her opinions that gave straightforward guidance to the lower courts. \n    \n\n            At the Supreme Court, she was perhaps best known for the opinion she wrote in United States v. Virginia, a decision that held that the all-male admissions policy at the state funded Virginia Military Institute was unconstitutional for its ban on women applicants. \n    \n\n            \u201cThe constitutional violation in this case is the categorical exclusion of women from an extraordinary educational opportunity afforded men,\u201d she wrote in 1996.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrbg film childhood clip_00000517.jpg\n\n\n\n\nvideo\n          \n\n\nRelated video\nBefore she was 'Notorious,' she was Kiki\n\n\n\n\n            Ginsburg faced discrimination herself when she graduated from law school in 1959 and could not find a clerkship. \n    \n\n            No one was more surprised than Ginsburg of the status she gained with young women in her late 70s and early 80s. She was amused by the swag that appeared praising her work, including a \u201cYou Can\u2019t have the Truth, Without Ruth\u201d T-shirt as well as coffee mugs and bobbleheads. Some young women went as far as getting tattoos bearing her likeness. A Tumblr dubbed her the \u201cNotorious R.B.G.\u201d in reference to a rap star known as \u201cNotorious B.I.G.\u201d The name stuck. One artist set Ginsburg\u2019s dissent in a religious liberty case to music. \n    \n\n            \u201cIt makes absolute sense that Justice Ginsburg has become an idol for younger generations,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan said at an event at the New York Bar Association in 2014. \u201cHer impact on America and American law has been extraordinary.\u201d\n    \n\n            \u201cAs a litigator and then as a judge, she changed the face of American anti-discrimination law,\u201d Kagan said. \u201cShe can take credit for making the law of this country work for women and in doing so she made possible my own career.\u201d  \n    \n\n            Ginsburg, even after her fifth diagnosis of cancer, was working on a book with one of her former clerks, Amanda Tyler. It was based on her life on gender equality.\n    \n\n    Dissents and strategy\n\n\n            Part of Ginsburg\u2019s renown came from her fierce dissents in key cases, often involving civil rights or equal protection.\n    \n\n            In 2007, the court heard a case concerning Lilly Ledbetter, who had worked as a supervisor at a Goodyear Tire plant in Alabama. Near the end of her career, Ledbetter discovered a pay disparity between her salary and the salaries of male co-workers. She filed a claim arguing she had received a discriminatorily low salary because of her sex, in violation of federal law. A majority of the court found against Ledbetter, ruling she had filed her complaints too late. Ginsburg wasn\u2019t impressed with that reasoning. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Maryland student Rachel Fink has a tattoo of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on her arm.\n\nJeff Simon/CNN\n\n\n\nvideo\n          \n\n\nRelated video\nMeet the woman with Ginsburg tattooed on her arm (2015)\n\n\n\n\n            \u201cThe court\u2019s insistence on immediate contest overlooks common characteristics of pay discrimination,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, urging Congress to take up the issue, which it did in 2009.\n    \n\n            In 2015, it was Ginsburg who led the liberal block of the court as it voted in favor of same-sex marriage with the critical fifth vote of Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy wrote the opinion and it was joined by the liberals, who chose not to write separately. Ginsburg was likely behind that strategy and she said later that had she written the majority she might have put more emphasis on equal protection.\n    \n\n            After the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens, Ginsburg was the most senior of her liberal colleagues and she had the power to assign opinions when the chief justice was on the other side.  \n    \n\n            She assigned herself an angry dissent when the court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013.\n    \n\n            \u201cThe sad irony of today\u2019s decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proven effective,\u201d she wrote. She compared racial discrimination to a \u201cvile infection\u201d and said early attempts to protect against it were like \u201cbattling the Hydra.\u201d \n    \n\n\n    Inside the life of a Supreme Court Justice\n  \n\nCNN Films\u2019 \u201cRBG\u201d chronicles the life and legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Watch Saturday, September 19 at 10 p.m. ET.\n\n\n\n\n\n            She also penned a partial dissent in a 2012 case concerning Obama\u2019s health care law, disagreeing with the conservative justices that the individual mandate was not a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 power under the Commerce Clause. She called the reasoning \u201ccrabbed\u201d but was satisfied that Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the fifth vote to uphold the law under the taxing power. \n    \n\n            Ginsburg puzzled some liberals with her criticisms of the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion \u2013 a case that was decided well before she took the bench. Although she said she felt like the result was right, she thought the Supreme Court should have limited itself to the Texas statute at hand instead of issuing a sweeping decision that created a target for opponents to abortion rights.\n    \n\n            She was in dissent in 2007 when the majority upheld a federal ban on a procedure called \u201cpartial birth abortion.\u201d She called the decision \u201calarming\u201d and said that it \u201ctolerates, indeed applauds, federal intervention to ban nationwide a procedure found necessary and proper in certain cases by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\u201d\n    \n\n            She voted with the majority, however, in 2016 when the court struck down a Texas abortion law that critics called one of the strictest nationwide.\n    \n\n            In July, Ginsburg filed another fierce dissent when the conservative majority allowed the Trump administration to expand exemptions for employers who have religious or moral objections to complying with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate.\n    \n\n            \u201cToday, for the first time, the Court casts totally aside countervailing rights and interests in its zeal to secure religious rights to the nth degree,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. She observed that the administration had said the new rules would cause thousands of women \u2013 \u201cbetween 70,500 and 126,400 women of childbearing age,\u201d she wrote \u2013 to lose coverage.\n    \n\n    Friendship with Scalia\n\n\n            Despite their ideological differences, her best friend on the bench was the late Justice Antonin Scalia. After the conservative\u2019s sudden death in February 2016, Ginsburg said he left her a \u201ctreasure trove\u201d of memories.  \n    \n\n            She was a life-long opera fan who appeared onstage in 2016 at the Kennedy Center for a non-speaking role in the Washington National Opera\u2019s \u201cThe Daughter of the Regiment.\u201d\n    \n\n            At speaking events she often lamented that while she dreamed of being a great opera diva, she had been born with the limited range of a sparrow.\n    \n\n            Her relationship with Scalia inspired Derrick Wang to compose a comic opera he titled \u201cScalia/Ginsburg\u201d that was based on opinions penned by the two justices.\n    \n\n            The actress Kate McKinnon also portrayed Ginsburg \u2013 wearing black robes and a trademark jabot \u2013 in a recurring \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit responding to the news of the day.\n    \n\n            Ginsburg suffered two bouts of cancer in 1999 and 2009 and received a stent implant in her heart but never missed a day of oral arguments. She was married to Martin Ginsburg, a noted tax attorney, for more than 50 years until his death in 2010 and they had two children. \n    \n\n            \u201cI would just like people to think of me as a judge who did the best she could with whatever limited talent I had,\u201d Ginsburg said at an event at the University of California Hastings College of Law in 2011, \u201cto keep our country true to what makes it a great nation and to make things a little better than they might have been if I hadn\u2019t been there.\u201d\n    \n\nThis story has been updated. \n\n\n  Sarah Mucha and

Now, more than ever, it\u2019s important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion.\n\nThis is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation.

To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry **will not be tolerated**. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.\n\nWith all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.\n\nWe ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you\u2019re able.

Thousands of protesters have been arrested, and the National Guard has been ordered to deploy in several major U.S. cities.\nGiven the hazards of protesting right now \u2014 especially in the middle of the pandemic \u2014 it\u2019s understandable if citizens are cautious about taking to the streets, even if they support activists\u2019 demands for justice and are against police racism and brutality.\nLuckily, there are many ways people can support protesters and communities impacted by police violence. Over the weekend, bail funds were trending across social media as an immediate way to provide relief to activists in jail, with threads like this one from filmmaker Matthew A. Cherry listing funds specific to each city. The National Bail Fund Network has a full directory of bail funds by state, and ActBlue has also set up a secure donation link that will let you simultaneously send money to over 70 (and counting) nationwide bail funds.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther options, such as legal funds and neighborhood relief efforts like Brooklyn\u2019s Bed-Stuy Strong\u00a0or NYC Black Mutual Aid, are great places to donate if people are looking to make a long-term, grassroots impact beyond this week\u2019s demonstrations; many of these mutual aid groups also go hand-in-hand with COVID-19 relief in underserved communities, and are in the market for volunteers. Beyond donations and protesting, defunding the police and making necessary policy changes will only happen from writing to and calling your local officials.\n\nHere are some of the bail funds and other organizations fighting against police injustice:\nNational\nLGBTQ Fund:\u00a0Bail fund providing relief to jailed LGBTQ people in 15 states and counting.\nMission: \u201cEach day, tens of thousands of LGBTQ people are held in jail or immigration detention because they cannot afford bail \u2014 for immigration status or charges like sleeping in public.

Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don\u2019t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we\u2019ve received, we\u2019ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.\n\nWe do understand that there\u2019s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.\n\nFor example:\n\n* \u201c*How would you feel about a \u2019if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,\u2019 button for Reddit?*\u201d is really just a feature suggestion.\n* \u201c*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*\u201d is a discussion question.\n\nOur philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your \u201dHow would you feel\u201d post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we\u2019ll be happy to manually review.\n\nThank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration.

Most recently he lived in Fort Pierce, about 120 miles southeast of Orlando. Fearing explosives, police evacuated about 200 people from the apartment complex where he lived while they looked through his residence for evidence.\n    \n\n            Mateen\u2019s parents, who are from Afghanistan, said he\u2019d expressed outrage after seeing two men kiss in Miami, but they didn\u2019t consider him particularly religious and didn\u2019t know of any connection he had to ISIS.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmar Mir Seddique Mateen \n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n            He was married in 2009 to a woman originally from Uzbekistan, according to the marriage license, but he filed documents to end the marriage in 2011.\n    \n\n            Sitora Yusufiy, interviewed by CNN in Boulder, Colorado, said she and Mateen were together about four months, though it took a long time to complete the divorce because they lived in different parts of the country after separating.\n    \n\n            Mateen was a normal husband at the beginning of their marriage but started abusing her after a few months, she said. She said Mateen was bipolar, although he was not formally diagnosed.  She also said Mateen had a history with steroids.  He was religious but she said she doesn\u2019t think his religion played in to the attack.\n    \n\n            Mateen had worked since 2007 as a security officer at G4S Secure Solutions, one of the world\u2019s largest private security companies.\n    \n\n            A message posted in Arabic on a dark web site associated with the ISIS news agency Amaq said \u201cthe armed attack that targeted a gay night club in the city of Orlando in the American state of Florida and that bore more than a 100 killed and wounded was carried out by an Islamic state fighter.\u201d\n    \n\n            But CNN\u2019s Salma Abdelaziz, who translated the message and closely monitors ISIS messaging, cautioned about taking the message at face value. \n    \n\n            She said the language is inconsistent with previous ISIS announcements and that the Arabic word for gay was used rather than an epithet normally used by ISIS. Also, there was no claim that the attack was directed, just an after-the-fact claim the gunman was an ISIS fighter, she said.\n    \n\n            At a Sunday afternoon news briefing, FBI Assistant Special Agent Ronald Hopper said the agency was aware of Mateen. The FBI interviewed him in 2013 and 2014 after he expressed sympathy for a suicide bomber, Hopper said.\n    \n\n             \u201cThose interviews turned out to be inconclusive, so there was nothing to keep the investigation going,\u201d Hopper said.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n            Mateen was not under investigation at the time of Sunday\u2019s shooting and was not under surveillance, Hopper said.\n    \n\n            In the past two weeks Mateen legally purchased a Glock pistol and a long gun, ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Trevor Velinor told reporters.\n    \n\n             It\u2019s not known if those weapons were used in the attack.\n    \n\n            \u201cHe is not a prohibited person. They can legally walk into a gun dealership and acquire and purchase firearms. He did so. And he did so within the last week or so,\u201d Velinor said. \n    \n\n    Scene inside the club\n\n\n            Pulse describes itself as \u201cthe hottest gay bar\u201d in the heart of Orlando. Hours before the shooting, the club urged partygoers to attend its \u201cLatin flavor\u201d event Saturday night.  The club is a vast, open space that was hosting more than 300 patrons late Saturday and into Sunday morning.\n    \n\n            People inside the cavernous nightclub described a scene of panic made more confusing by the loud music and darkness.\n    \n\n            \u201cAt first it sounded like it was part of the show because there was an event going on and we were all having a good time,\u201d clubgoer Andy Moss said. \u201cBut once people started screaming and shots just keep ringing out, you know that it\u2019s not a show anymore.\u201d\n    \n\n            Christopher Hansen said he was getting a drink at the bar about 2 a.m. when he \u201cjust saw bodies going down.\u201d He heard gunshots, \u201cjust one after another after another.\u201d\n    \n\n            The gunshots went on for so long that the shooting \u201ccould have lasted a whole song,\u201d he said.\n    \n\n            When the shots erupted, Hansen hit the ground, crawling on his elbows and knees, before he spotted a man who had been shot. \n    \n\n            \u201cI took my bandana off and shoved it in the hole in his back,\u201d Hansen said, adding that he saw another woman who appeared to be shot in the arm.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice investigate the back of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on Sunday, June 12. At least 49 people were killed there by Omar Mateen, who was shot and killed by Orlando police. It was the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.\n\nPhelan M.

One person hiding in the bathroom covered herself with bodies to protect herself. Some entertainers hid in a dressing room when the shooting started and escaped the building by crawling out when police removed the air conditioning unit.\n    \n\n            One of the bartenders said she hid under the glass bar.  Police came in and said, \u201cIf you are alive, raise your hand.\u201d  Then police got her and others out.  \n    \n\n            After the initial shooting, police surrounded the club while Mateen was inside with clubgoers hiding in bathrooms and other parts of the building. People inside the club were communicating on their phones with law enforcement from that time until around 5 a.m., when authorities used an armored vehicle to break down the door of the building. \n    \n\n    Hospital swamped with victims\n\n\n            Thirty-nine people and Mateen were pronounced dead at the scene, with two bodies found in the parking lot, Mayor Buddy Dyer said. Eleven people were taken to hospitals and pronounced dead there, he said.\n    \n\n            The City of Orlando is posting names of the deceased on a website after next of kin are notified. The youngest person among the first seven named, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, was 20 years old. \n    \n\n            Forty-three of the wounded people were patients on Sunday afternoon at Orlando Regional Medical Center, a hospital spokesperson said, with 26 operations being performed. \n    \n\nBlood donors rush to help in Orlando\n\n\n            Before Sunday, the deadliest shootings in U.S. history were at Virginia Tech in 2007 and Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, with 32 and 27 killed.

She was an up-and-coming singer who had appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice.\u201d Her shooter then killed himself.

They said they found an arsenal in his car that included, three assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, ammunition and a five-gallon bucket with chemicals that could be used to create an explosive device, officials said.  At 5 a.m. PT, police got a call about a prowler and found Howell, who told authorities he was looking for a friend to attend the LA Pride festival. \n    \n\n            There was no indication the arrest was related to the Orlando attack.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norlando nightclub shooting police press conference sot_00001921.jpg\n\nWKMG\n\n\n\nvideo\n          \n\n\nRelated video\nPolice: Approx. 20 dead in Orlando nightclub shooting\n\n\n\n\nAmerica\u2019s deadliest mass shootings\n\n\n    Police on leave\n\n\n            Eleven Orlando police officers and three sheriff\u2019s deputies who exchanged gunfire with the suspect will be temporarily relieved of duty pending an investigation.\n    \n\n            One officer suffered an eye injury when a bullet struck his Kevlar helmet, said Danny Banks, special agent in charge of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement\u2019s Orlando bureau.

No staff or overhead. We\u2019ve donated all of our time.On September 27th, those funds will be disbursed and now our attention must focus entirely on fulfilling the second promise - to honor the dead with action.Thoughts and prayers and symbols are not enough.We are committed to ensuring the lasting memorial is the real change of uprooting anti-LGBTQ hatred at the source.To keep this promise, we need you with us again.Our mission for the last 19 years has been to uproot bigotry and fight for equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Florida. Indeed, we fight for freedom for all Floridians to live without fear of violence, harm to their family, being fired from a job or refused service because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.The massacre at Pulse has made this vision a priority for millions more people in the state of Florida. We have never been closer to a huge breakthrough in LGBTQ protections in a state that will have ripple effects nationally.It is time for us to demand huge strides, not tiny measures, in changing the culture and the laws in Florida to ensure we stop the discrimination and violence that anti-LGBTQ hatred makes inevitable.We are asking you now to join us in achieving two goals that are ambitious but achievable if we have the courage to stand together.Banning anti-LGBTQ discrimination in Florida and passing gun violence prevention policies in the third most populous state in the country.Florida has a long and hateful history when it comes to the treatment of LGBTQ people and has been the springboard for national anti-gay campaigns from Anita Bryant to the Liberty Counsel. Florida-based groups have not only done harm here, they\u2019ve exported their prejudice to states around the nation and other countries as well.But the tide has turned in our favor as hearts have softened and minds have opened in the wake of Pulse. Shame on us if we let this moment pass without pushing with all our might for the state to treat us all as equals under the law and to end easy access to weapons of mass slaughter.We are so very grateful to have found the resources to help these people and their families get services, make up for lost wages, heal wounds and begin to put their lives back together.Will you stand with us again and fulfill the promise of real change as the lasting memorial #ForThe49?Inspired by our work in the aftermath of Pulse, an anonymous donor will match the first $100,000 raised for this campaign. That means the gift you give today will be doubled!Please see our new campaign for more information here: https://www.gofundme.com/forthe49_______________________________________This is the official Pulse Victims Fund page for Equality Florida, the state's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) civil rights organization.

They were often the only safe gathering place and this horrific act strikes directly at our sense of safety. June commemorates our community standing up to anti-LGBTQ violence at the Stonewall Inn, the nightclub that has become the first LGBTQ site recognized as a national monument.We have received a steady stream of emails and messages from those seeking to help or to make sense of the senseless. We make no assumptions on motive. We will await the details in tears of sadness and anger.

They can also be a vital community service, provide a community meeting point or offer assistance with non-emergency roles.For this reason, many people choose to donate to their local Rural Fire Brigade.Many Rural Fire Brigades conduct fundraising activities at community events, like through coin collections or BBQs. These proceeds go directly to assisting the brigade with community activities.Some brigades may accept donations or gifts which can be tax deductible for the donor. If you are considering a donation or gift to a brigade and wish to claim it as a tax deduction, you should check with the brigade if it has Deductible Gift Recipient status.To make a donation directly to your local brigade, simply contact your local brigade or your local Fire Control Centre. You can also use the credit card link below for many brigades. If your local brigade isn't listed, contact your nearest Fire Control Centre.Donations made directly to the NSW RFS are for the benefit of volunteer brigades and are always gratefully received and are a tremendous help. All donations over $2.00 are tax-deductible.Interested in making a donation? You can do so in three ways:Make a donation by credit cardYou can make a credit card donation to many brigades. If the brigade you wish to donate to is not listed, contact your local District Office on how to make a donation.Secure online donationsDeposit funds directlyYou can deposit funds directly using these details:Account Name: NSW Rural Fire ServiceBank: WestpacBSB: 032-001 Account No: 171051International transfersIf you're transferring funds from overseas, use these details:SWIFT 8 Digit Code: WPACAU2S; orSWIFT 11 Digit Code: WPACAU2SXXXIf there is no BSB option with your financial institution, please place the BSB followed by the account number together into the account number field.

You should retain this receipt for taxation purposes.If you have made a donation through direct depositDue to the large number of donations received, a tax deductible receipt will not be issued. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has advised it is not necessary to issue a tax deductible receipt and you should be able to claim the deduction as a donor. Your bank statement or internet banking printed copy of the transfer details is sufficient evidence of your donation for taxation purposes. Advice from the ATO is available here.International donors should seek advice regarding the tax status of any donations made.Again, thank you for your generous donation and your

Posts or comments about the situation are allowed so long as they don't violate the rules, but using the situation as an excuse to farm karma, spew transphobic rhetoric, or doxx people will not be tolerated and will result in removals and bans, as always.

We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her.\n  \n    We\u2019ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions.\n  \n\n\n    On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee\u2019s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.\n  \n\n\n    On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.\n  \n\n\n    We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.\n  \n\n\n    Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit\u2014including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself\u2014as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure\u2019s name should not get you banned.\n  \n    We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications.
