He'll end up with a total of 55,850 coins. He can then use that amount to buy 31 more months of Reddit Premium and have 21,750 coins left over. He can then use that amount to buy 12 more months of Reddit Premium and have 8,550 coins left over. He can then use that amount to buy 4 more months of Reddit Premium and have 4,150 coins left over. He can then use that amount to buy 2 more months of Reddit Premium and have 1,950 coins left over. He can then use that amount to buy 1 more month of Reddit Premium and have 850 coins left over. He can then use that amount to buy 1 more week of Reddit Premium and have 450 coins left over.\n\nThis gives him 10 years 9 months and 1 week more of Reddit Premium.\n\nCombined with the 16.32 years from before, that leaves him with a minimum of 27 years of Reddit Premium.\n\nThe math (name of gift: cost of gift * amount bought):\n    \n    Take my power: 200*10\n    Bravo: 200*43\n    Wholesome Seal: 50*9\n    Narwhal salute: 50*21\n    All-Seeing Eye: 50*17\n    Made me smile: 500*11\n    Heart eyes: 500\n    Yas Queen: 250*5\n    Today I Learned: 250\n    Timeless Beauty: 250*31\n    Original: 250*3\n    Mind Blown: 250*21\n    It's Cute: 250\n    ELI5: 250\n    Awesome Answer: 250*10\n    Plus One: 200*10\n    Cake: 150*3\n    S: 40,000\n    I: 600*2\n    N: 500*2\n    OC: 400*6\n    E: 400\n    P: 300\n    Argentium: 20,000*10\n    Platinum: 1800*105\n    Pot o Coins: 1000*14\n    Wholesome: 500*2\n    Snoo Nice: 500*18\n    Ignite: 500*22\n    Helpful: 500*3\n    Gold: 500*246\n    Bless Up: 500*17\n    Doot Doot: 400*17\n    Bravo: 400*118\n    Updoot: 300*10\n    This: 300*6\n    Rocket Like: 300*9\n    Got the W: 300*42\n    GOAT: 300*87\n    Coin Gift: 300*15\n    2020 Vision: 300*6\n    Super Heart: 250*13\n    Stonks Rising: 200*52\n    Stonks Falling: 200\n    I'm Deceased: 200*64\n    I'd Like to Thank: 200*28\n    Dad's Time to Shine: 200\n    Press F: 150*28\n    Number 1 Dad: 150\n    Helpful: 150*2\n    Bless Up: 150*39\n    Wholesome: 125*20\n    Silver: 100*396\n    Lawyer Up: 75*25\n    Hugz: 75*16\n    Tree Hug: 70*2\n    Snek: 70*46\n    Facepalm: 70*13\n    Toasty at Home: 50*13\n    Take My Energy: 50*397\n    Quarantine 15: 50*18\n    Nothing To Do: 50*30\n    I am disappoint: 50*4\n    Dads Care: 50*5\n    Couch, Fridge: 50*7\n    Ally: 50*76\n    Safe & Social: 30*48\n    Home Time: 30*68\n    Healthcare Hero: 30*108\n    \nA coin is worth: $0.00398 each if we assume that everyone paid $1.99 for 500 coins.
